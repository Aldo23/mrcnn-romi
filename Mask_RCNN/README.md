# Mask R-CNN compatible with tf 1.x and GPU

This is not the original matterpot repository of MASK R-CNN available at  [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) .
In this repository only the module.py file has been updated integrating changes for compatibility with tf 1.x version and GPU processing.
The actual repository has been tested on mac, ubuntu and google colab environemnts.
Changes implemented on the original file are following issues presented in this [discussion](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/1754) and instructions included in the [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) by Adrian Rosebrock.
